Screen shot of the bottom portion of the Horiseon website.

View the source code and update HTML to semantic elements.
When I first viewed the code I noticed that it didn't have semantic elements, code was wrapped in the div element (non-semantic). I updated all the divs to semantic elements using the header, footer, section, article, and aside elements.
View the structure of the HTML elements and follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
This looked pretty spot on. Everything looks like it's in the right order and follows the styling of the web page.
Find the image elements and add accessible alt attributes to them.
Added the alt attribute to the three main column images with a detailed description of each image.
Find and verify the heading attributes that they fall in sequential order.
Moved the link below the title.
Find and verify the title element has a concise, descriptive title.
Updated title from "website" to the company name "Horiseon".
